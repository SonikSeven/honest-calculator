# Honest Calculator

This GitHub project houses a simple command-line calculator program written in Python. It provides basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Description

The calculator program allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations by entering a mathematical expression in the form of two operands and an operator. It provides support for the following operations:
- Addition (+)
- Subtraction (-)
- Multiplication (*)
- Division (/)

The program also offers the option to store and reuse the calculated results.

## Features

- Supports basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Provides feedback and prompts based on user input and results.
- Includes functionality to store and reuse calculated results.

## Requirements

- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

## Installation

This application is written in Python, so you'll need Python installed on your computer to run it. If you don't have Python installed, you can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
